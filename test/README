README for PuppetMaster/Test
============================

First, you can create a file where you specify the name of each remote
hosts. For instance::

    keats
    whitman
    dickinson

You can also add an empty line or a wrong name to see if PuppetMaster can
manage these kind of exceptions.


SSH connection and PuppetMaster checking
----------------------------------------

Suppose you text file named 'host_file', you can launch::

    python remote_hosts_test.py host_file

In case you would like to use PuppetMaster's SSH configuration do::

    python remote_hosts_test.py host_file yes


Module testing with unittest
----------------------------

To launch all tests where ``host_file`` is the file where there are host
names, do::

    python tests.py -f host_file

If you would like to check one of these 3 modules:

  - ``host``
  - ``network``
  - ``program_manager``

you can do::

    python tests.py -f host_file -m MODULE_NAME

In case you would like to use PuppetMaster's SSH configuration do::

    python tests.py -f host_file --force-ssh-config
