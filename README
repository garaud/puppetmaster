README for PuppetMaster.


About
----- 

This directory contains 2 Python modules ('network.py' and
'program_manager.py') which can be useful if you would like to launch several
programs on remote hosts.


------------
Requirements
------------

These modules were written under Python version 2.5.

1. You have to install 'dsh'. It can be downloaded from this
   website: http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/software/downloads/list.cgi 
   It is an implementation of a wrapper for executing multiple remote shell
   (rsh, remsh, ssh) commands. 'man dsh' for help.

2. You must create these directories:
   mkdir ~/.dsh
   mkdir ~/.dsh/group

3. You must write the names of hosts in a file.
   For instance in ~/.dsh/group/all:
   node001
   node002
   node003
   node004

4. You can test the following commands in a terminal:
      dsh -r ssh -Mc -g all 'echo `uptime`'
   to get the 'uptime' for each host. Or
      dsh -r ssh -Mc -g all 'cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep ^processor | wc -l'
   to have the number of processors for each host.


------------
Installation
------------

Just move or link the modules 'network.py' and 'program_manager.py' to a path
which appears in your PYTHONPATH variable (for instance '~/usr/lib/python').

OR

Add this directory to your PYTHONPATH variable.

Then, you just do 'import network' and 'import program_manager' in a Python
script.


----
Test
----

You can launch 'python remote_hosts_test.py' in the directory 'test' to know
if you do not have any access problem. You can try too:
    cd test
    python tests.py
It checks the modules 'network.py' and 'program_manager.py'.

Moreover, you have a few scripts in 'example':
    - program.py
    - remote.py


-------------
Documentation
-------------

A soft description of each class and each method is available in the code. You
can also generate the documentation with Doxygen in the directory 'doc'. Read
'doc/REAMDE' to have more explanations.
