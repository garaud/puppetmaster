README for cluster management.


About
----- 

This directory contains 2 Python modules ('network.py' and
'program_manager.py') which can be useful if you would like to launch several
programs on remote hosts.


------------
Requirements
------------

These modules were written under Python version 2.5.

1. You have to install the shell command 'dsh'. It can be downloaded in this
   website: http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/software/downloads/list.cgi 
   It can be execute multiple remote shell on remote hosts. 'man dsh' for
   help.

2. You must create these directories:
   mkdir ~/.dsh
   mkdir ~/.dsh/group

3. You must write the names of hosts in a file.
   For instance in ~/.dsh/group/all:
   node001
   node002
   node003
   node004

4. You can test the following commands:
      dsh -r ssh -Mc -g all 'echo `uptime`'
   to get the 'uptime' for each host. Or
      dsh -r ssh -Mc -g all 'cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep ^processor | wc -l'
   to have the number of processors for each host.


------------
Installation
------------

Just copy or link the modules 'network.py' and 'program_manager.py' to a path
which appears in your PYTHONPATH variable. You can launch 'python
test/remote_hosts_test.py' to know if you do not have any access problem. You
can try 'python test/tests.py' (it checks the modules 'network.py' and
'program_manager.py')
