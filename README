README for PuppetMaster.


About
----- 

This project contains 3 Python modules ('./src/host.py', './src/network.py'
and './src/program_manager.py'). They can be useful if you would like to know
the load on remotes hosts or launch several programs on remote hosts.


------------
Requirements
------------

These modules were written under Python version 2.5.


------------
Installation
------------

Assume you have a directory which is defined in your PYTHONPATH. For instance
'$HOME/usr/lib/python'. Go to this directory and do:

ln -s /path/to/puppetmaster/src puppetmaster

Then, you just do 'from puppetmaster import *' in a Python script.


----
Test
----

First, you can create a file where you specify the name of each remote
hosts. For instance:
    node001
    node002
    node003
    node004

You can launch 'python remote_hosts_test.py' in the directory './test' to know
if you do not have any access problem.

 You can try too:
    cd ./test
    python tests.py -m MODULE_NAME
It checks the module 'MODULE_NAME'. You can also do:
    python tests.py -m all -f host_file
It checks every module for a list of hosts defined in the file 'host_file'.

Moreover, you have a few scripts in './example':
    - program.py
    - remote.py


-------------
Documentation
-------------

A soft description of each class and each method is available in the source
code. You can also generate the documentation with Doxygen in the directory
'./doc'. Read './doc/REAMDE' for more explanations.
